# Clustersong
## Abstract
The goal of this project is to explore a more novel way of categorizing music than genres.  While genres are powerful information and have adapted to a very fine level of granularity with sub-genres, they are not exclusively about how a song or album might sound.  Often, genres encapsulate important pieces of history and culture into them as certain markers.

Clustersong aims to explore the use of unsupervised machine learning to cluster songs together, and thus create new labels with a little more control on what exactly is input.  The hope with these labels is to create something that tries to bin similar sounding songs together, with less attachment to a band's history or even other songs on an album.  I have decided to call these new labels aural palettes, and while I do not think that I have conclusively found all of them, or even the proper granularity of them, the early results already show some trends.  The meat of this analysis can be found in [this notebook](./code/04-analysis-and-conclusions.ipynb)
